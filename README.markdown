The ReactionBot is an IRC client written in Python. It sits in channels like any other
IRC bot and replies with links to hilarious gifs for phrases you've set up.

Dawn: wooahhhh did you see Rocco's email?
ReactionBot: woah -> http://i.imgur.com/57VNz.gif
Dawn: Ha ha ha, that's so funnny

What was an off the cuff social experiment has somehow become one of my greatest achivements!

Adam: Oh why is there no milk?
ReactionBot: no milk -> http://i.minus.com/irEAQS85EIn6k.gif
Adam: ReactionBot++ # how I feel

The ReactionBot makes insults more insulting, emotions more prevalent and it rewards people for a witty retort! Because a gif speaks a hundred thousand words!

Phill: The reactionbot is here!
Phill: BOOM!
ReactionBot: boom -> http://i.imgur.com/ytM4Q.gif
